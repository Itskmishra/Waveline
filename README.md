## About
I have tried designing a visually stunning and consistent user interface using Tailwind CSS. To enhance the development workflow and ensure seamless styling across the application, I have leveraged the power of several libraries, including class-variance-authority, clsx, and tailwind-merge.


I followed a component-based approach, creating reusable and modular components adhering to best practices like prop-typing, separation of concerns, and consistent naming conventions. This ensured maintainability and scalability throughout the development process.
